# Weather-testing

## Description

Project within the final thesis, an elementary playground.

Task:

Modify the A* algorithm so that it builds a time-optimized path based on the 16 (24) cell neighborhood, 
allows you to build trajectories for both a motorized vessel and a sailing vessel using weather data and a sea depth map.

## Table of Contents 

AStar - main package with modified A* algorithm
DataView - package to test/modify the view of some data
Wind - example of how to display wind speed and direction

## Usage

Just run the star_algorithm.py script

## Tests
